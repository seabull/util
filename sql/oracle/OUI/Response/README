To Record response file:
./runInstaller -ignoreSysPrereqs -record -destinationFile /usr0/oracle/temp/oraclient10g/MyResponse/10gclient.rsp

To start OUI using response file:
./runInstaller -responseFile <filename> <optional_parameters>
e.g.
./runInstaller -responseFile file1.rsp -nowelcome 
./runInstaller -responseFile file1.rsp -silent
./runInstaller -ignoreSysPrereqs -responseFile /usr0/oracle/temp/oraclient10g/MyResponse/10gclient.rsp
# In complete silent mode, a log file filentInstall<timestamp>.log will be generated either in oraInventory or /tmp.

Comments:

# Currently for 10g on Linux, those symlinks link to the absolute paths,
# if installed copy of Oracle software changed, they need to be re-link to the 
# correct location. (find $ORACLE_HOME -type l | xargs ls -l | grep $OLD_ORACLE_HOME)
# bin/lbuilder -> nls/lbuilder/lbuilder
# jdk/man/ja -> jdk/man/ja_JP.eucJP
# lib/libclntsh.so -> lib/libclntsh.so.10.1

Document:
#-----------------------------------------------------------------
By default, the OUI inventory is located in a series of directories within the following directories:

/Program Files/Oracle/Inventory (on Windows)
<user_home>/oraInventory (on UNIX)

If you attempt to perform a silent installation on a UNIX computer 
where no Oracle products have been installed, you will get an error message. 
Before you can perform a silent installation on such a computer, you must 
first run the script oraInstRoot.sh, which is saved in the /oraInventory 
directory. You must run this script with root privileges. This enables OUI 
to set up the central inventory on a clean machine.

Usage:
runInstaller [-options] [(<CommandLineVariable=Value>)*]

Where options include:
	-help  Displays above usage.
	-silent  For silent mode operations, the inputs can be a response file or a list of command line variable value pairs.
	-responseFile <Path>  Specifies the response file and path to use.
	-formCluster  To install the Oracle clusterware in order to form the cluster.
	-remoteShell <Path>  Used only for cluster installs, specifies the path to the remote shell program on the local cluster node.
	-remoteCopy <Path>  Used only for cluster installs, specifies the path to the remote copy program on the local cluster cluster.
	-record -destinationFile <Path>  For record mode operation, information is recorded in the destination file path.
