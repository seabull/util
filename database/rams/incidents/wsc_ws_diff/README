who_service table is not updated if a user is expired,
even though who_service_charge is updated.

To fix it, call whoserviceupdates without if statement.

integrity.prod.lst	- From Prod DB before changes
integrity.qa.lst	- From QA DB before changes
integrity.new.sql	- With changes ready to go into prod.

More problems:

- who_service_charge should be sync-ed by who_service triggers.
- host_service_charge should be sync-ed by host_service triggers.

Problem 1

For hosts, when changing assetno, costing.hostServiceChanges fails to
update host_service_change table since machtab has not been sync-ed with 
capequip table (where the assetno change initiated) yet.

To solve this problem, make machtab a special case in capequip trigger that handles
assetno changes, i.e. let it sync machtab first.

Problem 2 

For both hosts and users, the call to host/whoServicesUpdate should not have condition.
and the subsequent call of Costing.host/whoCharges is useless since the function should be taken
care of by host/whoServicesUpdate (with condition if statement removed).
