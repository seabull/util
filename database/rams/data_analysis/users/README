 about part timers and residual
---------------------------------------------
1. users from payroll (tmcd and labor) are recorded and update/create their dist_names entry as
<effort>/princ
2. who.charge_by decides whether a user follow project/subproject or effort/princ distribution in dist_names
	who.charge_by=null --- follow effort/princ (look up distribution using Integrity.distQuery from Integrity.whoDist)
	who.charge_by=P    --- follow project/subproject

	if a user's dist_names.pct is null, then use the last known pct (which is who.pct)
	(Notes: All <effort>/princ entries in dist_names have pct as null)
	if a user's data does not show up from payroll (i.e. no <effort>/princ found in dist_names)
	   and his distribution based on who.project/subproject can not be found in dist_names
	then
		this princ is marked as 'X' in who.dist_src
		who.pct is set to 1 if he is part time (dist_src used to be lower letter)
		who.pct is set to 5 if he is full time (dist_src used to be capital letter)

	Notes: a. monthly process (i.e. Run package) does not touch project/subproject in dist_names
		It only updates/deletes/creates <effort>/princ entries in dist_names.
		b. dist_names triggers do not update who_service_charge/who_service tables
		c. who triggers update who_service/who_service_charge tables

--
-- services.monthly decides whether who.pct should be used on top of distribution (dist)
-- or 100% should be used for distribution
-- e.g.
-- dist_a account_a 50%
-- dist_a account_b 50%
--
-- if services.monthly is not null, then charges for dist_a will be
--      50%*who.pct to account_a
--      50%*who.pct to account_b
-- if services.monthly is null, then charges for dist_a will be
--      50% to account_a
--      50% to account_b
--
-- For machines, it totally independent of who.pct even if it follows user (machtab.usrprinc). 
-- i.e. machtab.dist_src='U'
